# Animations Folder

Place your webm animation files in this directory:

- `left-animation.webm` - Animation that will appear on the left side of the orbit
- `right-animation.webm` - Animation that will appear on the right side of the orbit

The animations will automatically be loaded and displayed on the landing page once added.
