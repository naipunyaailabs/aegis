Got it — I read your DOCX and pulled out every fillable spot. Below is a precise field map you can turn into a form (plus a clean data model). I’ve grouped placeholders, explained what each means, how to validate it, and how it appears in the template.

---

# Field map (from your DOCX)

## A) Company & meeting header

* **company_name** — Legal name of the company. Appears twice: `[Name of Company]` and within the meeting title line. Must match ROC records.
* **meeting_number** — Ordinal/count of the meeting (e.g., “3rd”). Placeholder: `[No. of Meeting]`.
* **meeting_type** — “Board of Directors Meeting” or other meeting type (kept as text). Placeholder: `[Type of Meeting]` (though the body already states “BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING”). Keep consistent.
* **meeting_day** — Day name (e.g., “Monday”). Placeholder: `[Day of Meeting]`.
* **meeting_date** — Full date (e.g., “03 June 2024”). Placeholder: `[Date of Meeting]`.
* **time_commenced** — Start time (e.g., “11:00 A.M.”). Placeholder: `[Time: COMMENCED AT]`.
* **time_concluded** — End time (e.g., “12:15 P.M.”). Placeholder: `[Time: CONCLUDED AT]`.
* **meeting_place** — Venue / Registered office address. Placeholder: `[Place of Meeting]`.

## B) Attendance block

* **present_directors** — Ordered list of directors present (names as per MCA). Placeholders shown as `[from MCA]` twice (one labelled “Chairman”, one labelled “Director”). In output, each becomes a line item. Also used later in DIN-linked sections.
* **in_attendance** — Non-director attendees (e.g., “Authorised Officer”). Placeholder `[Manual]` is the attendee’s name/role; appears twice around “Authorised Officer” and later as “Mr. [Manual] occupied the Chair…”. Use this if the Chair is not a director named above. If your Chair is one of the directors, set this to that person or override the “Mr. [Manual]” line with the Chair’s actual name.
* **chairman_name** — The person who chaired the meeting (should match one of the directors or an authorised chair). Placeholder occurs in “Mr. [Manual] occupied the Chair…”.

> Note: If  *all directors are present* , the “Leave of absence” section stays as-is. If not, you’ll want a toggle + a list of absentees and reason. The current template assumes all present.

## C) Quorum & minutes confirmation

* **previous_minutes_date** — Date of previous Board meeting whose minutes are being confirmed. Placeholder: `[Auto]`. You can auto-pick the last meeting date from your DB; otherwise expose as a date field.

## D) Disclosures under the Companies Act

Two repeated pairs appear — name + DIN — both labelled “[from MCA]”:

* **interest_disclosures** — Array of `{name, din}` under Section 184 noted. Text shows:
  * `Mr. [from MCA] (DIN: [from MCA])` (twice). Replace with all directors who filed general notice of concern/interest.
* **disqualification_declarations** — Array of `{name, din}` under Section 164(2) noted (again, the same lines pattern).

## E) Statutory auditor’s payment

* **auditor_payment_number** — Numeric amount (e.g., 75000). Placeholder: `Rs. [Manual]/-`.
* **auditor_payment_words** — Same amount in words (e.g., “Seventy Five Thousand Only”). Placeholder: `(Rupees [Manual] Only)`. Derive from the number to keep them in sync.
* **auditor_payment_year** — Financial year end year (e.g., `2025`). Appears as `31st March, 20___`. Validate as 4-digit year.

## F) Financial statements approval

* **fs_year** — Year component for 31 March dates (e.g., `2025`). Appears multiple times: `31st March 20____`. Also appears inside the resolution with `<year>` markers. Keep consistent everywhere.
* **rpt_fin_year_range** — For related party transactions, appears as `<2025 to  2026>__` (range). Ensure it matches your accounting period. Prefer “2024–25” or “FY 2024–25” format consistently across docs.
* **signatory_1_name** , **signatory_1_role** (likely “Director”), **signatory_1_din** — Appears as `Mr. <Director Name>, __, Director (DIN: _<DIN Number>___)`.
* **signatory_2_name** ,  **signatory_2_role** , **signatory_2_din** — Appears similarly: `Mr. __<Director Name>__, Director (DIN: __<DIN>__)`. Allow roles to vary (“Managing Director”, etc.).

## G) Directors’ Report approval

* **directors_report_year** — Year in `… ended on 31st March, 20<year>`. Keep identical to **fs_year** unless you genuinely have a mismatch.

## H) AGM notice & meeting details

* **agm_number** — Ordinal count for AGM. Placeholder: `<no of meeting>`. Appears three times.
* **agm_day_name** — Day of the week for AGM (e.g., “Friday”). Placeholder: `<day>`.
* **agm_day** — Numeric day (e.g., `12`). Placeholder: `the ____ Day`.
* **agm_month** — Month name (e.g., “July”). Placeholder: `of ____, 20____`.
* **agm_year** — 4-digit year. Placeholder: `20____`.
* **agm_time** — Time string with A.M./P.M. Placeholder: `at ____ p.m.` (note: the template forces “p.m.”; support A.M. as well).
* **registered_office_address** — Address text after “Situated at … [From website: MCA]”. Use the official address from MCA master data.
* **chairman_short_name** — Shown as `Mr. <Chairman>, Chairman of the Company…`. This should align with  **chairman_name** ; consider generating consistent salutation + name.

## I) Sign-off block

* **recording_date** — “Date of Recording : ____”. Date when minutes were drafted.
* **signing_date** — “Date of Signing : ____”. Date when Chair signs the minutes.
* **signing_place** — Place of signing. “Place : ____”.
* **signing_chairman_name** — The “Chairman” label at the right; typically same as  **chairman_name** . Keep consistent.

# Validation & formatting rules (recommended)

* **Dates:** render as “DD Month YYYY” (e.g., `03 June 2024`) for all narrative text; store ISO internally.
* **Times:** keep “A.M.”/“P.M.” or “AM/PM” consistently across the document; the template currently shows “p.m.” — either standardise to uppercase or stick to template style everywhere.
* **Ordinals:** programmatically convert integers (1, 2, 3…) → “1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th…”.
* **Amounts:** add Indian digit-grouping (“1,50,000”) and **derive words** from the number to avoid mismatch.
* **MCA fields:** Names and DINs should come from a trusted source; block submission if DIN format fails (`8` digits).
* **Consistency guards:** `fs_year === directors_report_year`, `auditor_payment_year === fs_year`, and AGM year should be ≥ FS year.
* **Conditional text:** If any of the “lists” (e.g., interest disclosures) are empty, remove the lines rather than leaving placeholder commas.

# How to wire this into generation (Node.js approach you’ll like)

Your template uses square-bracket tokens (e.g., `[Manual]`). For robust generation, I recommend **one-time retagging** to `{{handlebars_style}}` and using  **docxtemplater** :

1. **Retag pass** (one-off):
   * Replace `[Name of Company]` → `{{company_name}}`, etc., per the mapping table.
   * Replace repeating director lines with a loop block:
     ```
     {{#present_directors}}
     {{name}}
     {{/present_directors}}
     ```
   * Do the same for disclosures arrays.
2. **Generate** :

```bash
   npm i docxtemplater pizzip @types/docxtemplater @types/pizzip
   npm i number-to-words dayjs
```

1. **Code sketch** (core idea):
   ```js
   import PizZip from 'pizzip';
   import Docxtemplater from 'docxtemplater';
   import fs from 'fs';
   import dayjs from 'dayjs';

If you don’t want to retag, you can still do a **programmatic search-and-replace** inside the document XML for the exact bracketed tokens, but docxtemplater is safer for loops (present directors, disclosures) and for conditional sections.

If you want, I can also **retag your uploaded file** to a docxtemplater-ready template and hand you the ready-to-use `.docx` plus a minimal Next.js API route that takes this JSON and returns the generated file.
